# Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning Algorithms for Ola using R Programming

### ➡️ The repository consists of Code & Datasets used for the Sentiment Analysis

### ⚫️ Project Insights

1️⃣ The project consists of 2 algorithms for sentiment analysis

2️⃣ The first algorithm is Support Vector Machine that is used on the cleaned text  

3️⃣ The second algorithm is Naive Bayes which is also a classification algorithm

4️⃣ The Word Cloud is also generated for understanding view of tweets

5️⃣ The data is segregated into Negative & Positive

6️⃣ Various sentiments are also checked using Bar Plot for the dataset
